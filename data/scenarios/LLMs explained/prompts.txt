You are a professional scriptwriter for educational YouTube videos.

Create a detailed outline for a 10-minute video (~1500 words).

NICHE: LLMs explained
TOPIC: Tokens and context window. Main idea: context is input + output in tokens, and this is a real computational constraint.
AUDIENCE: Ages 14–25 (plus curious adults). Non‑technical viewers who use ChatGPT‑like tools but don’t code and don’t know ML jargon.

Required structure:
1. Hook (0:00-0:30) — Grab attention
2. Map (0:30-1:00) — What they'll learn
3. Main Content (1:00-8:00) — 3-5 key points
4. Takeaway (8:00-9:00) — Actionable steps
5. CTA (9:00-10:00) — Subscribe prompt

For each section provide:
- Key points (3-5 bullets)
- Suggested visual type
- Estimated duration

IMPORTANT:
- Mark any historical facts with [VERIFY]
- Mark any statistics/numbers with [SOURCE NEEDED]
- Do NOT invent specific dates, percentages, or attributions


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Excellent. Now, following the outline we just created, write the FULL SPOKEN TEXT for every section. IN ENGLISH.


Requirements:
- Conversational, active voice, short sentences.
- Use the estimated duration from the outline.
- Classify claims inline: 🟢 [SAFE], 🟡 [CAUTIOUS], 🔴 [STRICT].
- List all CAUTIOUS and STRICT claims at the end of the text.

Expected narrative length: 1500 - 2500 words.

|-------|------|--------|

Actions: KEEP / VERIFY / REMOVE / REPHRASE

Flag any harmful content:
- Medical/financial/legal advice
- Unverified promises
- Misleading comparisons
