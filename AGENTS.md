# OpenSpec Instructions

## Communication & Coding Rules
- **Language**: All communication with the user must be in **Russian**.
- **Tone**: Always use formal address (**Вы**) when communicating with the user.
- **Coding**: All code, comments, and strings within the code must be in **English**.
- **Formatting**: Questions to the user should be presented as a **flat numbered list**.

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.
